1. float value = 102.0; //because its double
2. float value1 = (1f * 0.0);//does NOT compile, compiler says cast to float:  float value1 = (float) (1f * 0.0);
3. float value1 = 1f * (boolean)0;//does NOT compile, cannot cast int to boolean
4. /*
* /* ferret */
*/
Does not compile, everything from the first /* to the first */ is part of the comment, which mean compiler sees
something like /* */ */. there is an extra */
5. public class Animal{
    private String name;
    }
    class Animal2 {
    }
I can have two classes in the same file. However, public class needs to match the filename.
