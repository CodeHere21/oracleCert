1. float value = 102.0; //because its double
2. float value1 = (1f * 0.0);//does NOT compile, compiler says cast to float:  float value1 = (float) (1f * 0.0);
3. float value1 = 1f * (boolean)0;//does NOT compile, cannot cast int to boolean
4. /*
* /* ferret */
*/
Does not compile, everything from the first /* to the first */ is part of the comment, which mean compiler sees
something like /* */ */. there is an extra */
5. public class Animal{
    private String name;
    }
    class Animal2 {
    }
I can have two classes in the same file. However, public class needs to match the filename.
6. I can use Public as identifier, because java is case sensitive
7. Java does not have operator overloading or pointers.
8. Javac compiles .java file into .class file.
9. 0b is the prefix for a binary value and is correct. 0X is the prefix for a hexadecimal value. This value CAN
be assigned to many primitive types, including int and double.
10. int amount = 9L INCORRECT!! Correct way is: long amount=9L.
